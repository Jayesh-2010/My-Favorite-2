           <p>Everybody has different hobbies that he or she would like to do for fun or relaxation. They can be either physical activities like jogging, football, swimming, skateboarding… or mental activities like reading, watching movies, playing computers… and depend on each personality. For me, soccer is my hobby because it’s part of my life and I cannot live without it.

               Living in country like America, soccer is the king of sports. That is why it is not surprising that my childhood has grown up with the soccer’s ball until today. My mom told me that I liked kicking the ball around and had so much fun with it when I was only about two years old. Since then, playing soccer is my favorite’s sport and it is my hobby whenever I have free time. It is interesting and amazing, especially the feeling when I score a goal or my teammates do it. That feeling fulfills in me like I have just achived something very important. Playing soccer also helps me to relax and be confident when I have stress and frustration. For instance, after doing assignment or studying all day long, I feel tired and exhausted. However, having fun with the ball such as kicking it against the wall or trying to do some tricks, all of my tiresome and exhaustion die out.
